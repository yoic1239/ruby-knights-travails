# Knights Travails
Project description: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails#project-solution

Build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The knight_moves function is build in the Knight module. You can find the shortest path of a knight from one square to another square in the chessboard with the following code.
```
> Knight.knight_moves([0, 0], [7, 7])
=> You made it in 6 moves!  Here's your path:
  [0, 0]
  [1, 2]
  [2, 4]
  [3, 6]
  [4, 4]
  [5, 6]
  [7, 7]
```
